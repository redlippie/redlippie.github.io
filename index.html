    The images show 100 years of Vogue. From the 1910s -1950s nearly everyone (artwork and photos) had Red lips. Either by drawing them in or lipstick.
    Makeup had with out a doubt changed how many women viewed themselves. But red lipstick is on a different level. There was a entire era that focus on 
    having red lips. Either though natrual ways, like biting your lips making blood rush to them or makeup. During the 1910s-1920s we can see women wear red lips to
    have a glamorous look about them. Because we can see movie stars wear it. Then we can see a shift in the meaning in the 1940s. With macosts like Rosie the Riviner women were felt
    pressure to work and look good while doing it. During this time we can see colors like 'Victory Red' (1941) become popular. And from then these working ladies became housewives
    again, while wearing the red lipstick. We can see this red lip trend stand the test of time, while it may not be the forefront of trends, no one puts down a classic red lippie.
