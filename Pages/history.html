            Before the 20th centrey red lipstick had a bad conotation around it. It was related to sex work, being impolie, or even communicating with the devil.
            One of the most important movements that changed this was Woman's Sufferage. Elizabeth Arden handed out red lipstick
            during marches, because we as women had the right to vote, as well as the freedom to do whatever we want.

                 Red lipstick was used throughout the decade most importantly to create a popular trend called the Cupidâ€™s bow. The red lip 
                 was used all over in western culture, & it began as a form of protest to get votes. But it has become way more than that, 
                 this could maybe be considered the most impactful form of protest.
