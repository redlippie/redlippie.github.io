            Before the 20th centrey red lipstick had a bad conotation around it. It was related to sex work, being impolie, or even communicating with the devil.
            One of the most important movements that changed this was Woman's Sufferage. Elizabeth Arden handed out red lipstick
            during marches, because we as women had the right to vote, as well as the freedom to do whatever we want.

                 Red lipstick was used throughout the decade most importantly to create a popular trend called the Cupid’s bow. The red lip 
                 was used all over in western culture, & it began as a form of protest to get votes. But it has become way more than that, 
                 this could maybe be considered the most impactful form of protest.

             The 1940s the america economy was helped, but unfor... it was because of World War II.
             With so many men being gone for war america used a lot of propaganda to encorenge women to get jobs in factories,
             military, or just cut back on their everyday lives for the war efforts. A lot of the posters and ads (if not all) showed
             women wearing red lipstick. Of course I can't show poster but the most promanate one are important to american culture.

         As I said before World War II propaganda displayed a lot of patriotic behavior which included all women wearing 
         red lipstick and showing a love of their American soldiers. With World War II propaganda it showed women being 
         nurses working in factories or even just gardening in their victory Gardens. During this time one of the most famous 
         Red Lipstick shades came out. It was Victory Red, another propaganda object but it became wildly popular and is offtan
         mimicked.

                    Fast forwarding 80 to the present day, it’s not as important to wear make up now as it was then are looked at as some sort of propaganda. But now it’s a way of encouragement or away to make yourself feel better. Almost going back to the original way red lipstick with use. A form of protest for our right to vote. Over the past eight years there have been numerous amount of research conducted on why the color red is so seductive and so persuasive. 

In research from 2016 conducted by aniela Niesta Kayser  ,Maria Agthe , Jon K. Maner
 concluded by saying: 
“In conclusion, the present research adds to an emerging body of work showing that red carries special meaning in mating-related contexts. Women appear to selectively use or avoid using red as a sexual signal in their choice of clothing, accessories, and makeup. This research reveals a subtle but potentially powerful sexual strategy that women use to attract highly desirable mates while potentially avoiding unattractive ones.”

The color red is very important to humans, and just over the past 100 years I’ve demonstrated how much of a impact it has made. We as humans are built to like the color red more. But it’s really been demonstrated with women and their lips over the past 100 years
