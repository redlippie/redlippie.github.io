            Before the 20th centrey red lipstick had a bad conotation around it. It was related to sex work, being impolie, or even communicating with the devil.
            One of the most important movements that changed this was Woman's Sufferage. Elizabeth Arden handed out red lipstick
            during marches, because we as women had the right to vote, as well as the freedom to do whatever we want.
